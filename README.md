# cloud-init-scripts
There are 4 scripts that you can execute on base CentOs/RHEL or Ubuntu to install cloud-init and configure the image to work with vSphere customization with dhcp or ip static assigments

There are two files for each of the linux distros and the one with a myblog at the end of the file name uses a cron job approach where the one without uses a custom runonce service that we create instead of using a cron job. Both works but at the end there are two different aproaches here, your welcome to use which ever once you prefer.
